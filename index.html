          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I have some experience with Python because I had taken an Intro to Programming course last semester and some web programming experiences mostly with HTML, CSS and some Javascript when I took the Intro to IT course also in last semester.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I see myself as a programmer more than a designer. That does not mean I have no experience with design and UX/UI because I aim to be a web back-end developer. Maybe it will change in the future when I want to take more responsibilities and become a full-stack developer. </div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>When I was in secondary school, I have a computer science subject which was one of two subjects that I liked the most besides mathematics. Those two subjects base on logical thinking and I like to solve problems. Therefore, I decided to take an IT when I come to university. the reason why I choose RMIT because I want to experience the multinationals environment in which I can work with people around the world.   </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>As I said previously, I aim to be a back-end developer so what I am hoping to get thought this course is to have basic knowledge about developing a web how the front-end and back-end world and create a server for an actual website using PHP.</div>
