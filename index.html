          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>I have some experience with Python because I had taken an Intro to Programming course last semester and some web programming experiences mostly with HTML, CSS and some Javascript when I took the Intro to IT course also in last semester.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>I see myself as a programmer more than a designer. That does not mean I have no experience with design and UX/UI because I aim to be a web back-end developer. Maybe it will change in the future when I want to take more responsibilities and become a full-stack developer. </div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>When I was in secondary school, I have a computer science subject which was one of two subjects that I liked the most besides mathematics. Those two subjects base on logical thinking and I like to solve problems. Therefore, I decided to take an IT when I come to university. the reason why I choose RMIT because I want to experience the multinationals environment in which I can work with people around the world.   </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>As I said previously, I aim to be a back-end developer so what I am hoping to get thought this course is to have basic knowledge about developing a web how the front-end and back-end world and create a server for an actual website using PHP.</div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>I have a good level of discipline and I expect my partner will have a high level of discipline too because we will set a schedule for the whole project before we start. Besides the experiences with the material, for example, HTML and CSS, the team members have to finish the work before the deadline for the testing stages which is important and shouldn't be missed. Another thing that I expect is my partners have open-minded to communicate and show their ideas. I have done a lot of paired and group works for the last 2 years and sometimes there were some misunderstandings and debates because of the failure in communication in the team. Therefore, team members should have met regularly to show what they have done after the last meeting and what the problems they meet so others can help.   </div>
